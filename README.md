# Bitwarden Desktop :: AUR
> *AUR package for installing Bitwarden Desktop on Arch Linux*

This is the canonical source of the [`bitwarden-desktop`](#) AUR package managed by me. I will try to keep updating it as much it gets updated from Bitwarden's release schedule, but you can always submit PRs to update it!

## Installation
```shell
$ yay -S bitwarden-desktop
```

## License
This repository doesn't hold any license, you can fork this and add your own modifications as you like!~
